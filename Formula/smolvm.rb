  # The release tarball's dylibs are already self-contained (@rpath / @loader_path
  # sibling references). Homebrew's automatic dylib relocation, however, rewrites
  # some of those sibling refs (libepoxy, virglrenderer) to absolute
  # /opt/homebrew/opt/<formula>/lib paths — which point at formulae/taps the user
  # doesn't have (hence the "requires the tap slp/krun" warning) and only resolve
  # on a machine that happens to have those libs installed. Re-point every
  # dependency that has a bundled sibling back to @loader_path so the bundle is
  # self-contained again, then re-sign (relocation invalidated the ad-hoc
  # signature). Runs after Homebrew's relocation, so it's the last word.

    <<~EOS
      smolvm runs real microVMs, so it needs hardware virtualization:
        - macOS: Hypervisor.framework (macOS 11+ on Apple Silicon) — no extra setup.
        - Linux: access to /dev/kvm. Add yourself to the kvm group if needed:
            sudo usermod -aG kvm "$USER"   # then log out and back in

      Get started:
        smolvm run alpine echo hello
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/smolvm --version")
  end
end
